 * Sound and light gives us some good feedback from our HERO, but what about
 * when we need numbers and the Serial Console isn't available?  Today we
 * introduce a 4-digit 7-segment display (TM1637).  This is mostly for numbers,
 * like a counter or perhaps a clock display, but with some imagination we can
 * also show some characters.

 * The TM1637 library takes an array of 4 bytes to represent each of the 4 display
 * digits.  Within each byte, bit 0 is segment A, bit 1 is segment B etc.  A zero
 * indicates the segment is off, a 1 bit indicates the segment is on.
 *
 * NOTE: To show the individual bits in each byte we will use BINARY number notation
 *       consisting of a "0b" followed by eight bits that can be either 0 or 1 (ex.
 *       0b01010101).

/*
 * A 7-segment display is shaped like an "8" and has 7 segments (A through G) that can be
 * lit up. The diagram below shows the placement of each of the segments.
 *
 *   A
 * F   B
 *   G
 * E   C
 *   D
 *
 * You can set the individual segments per digit to spell words or create other symbols.
 * The TM1637 library provides constants for each segment on the display.  If you hover
 * your mouse over each of these constants you can see that each defines a byte with only
 * one bit set to 1.  SEG_A = 0b00000001, SEG_B = 0b00000010, etc.
 *
 * The Arduino C++ language uses the '|' operator to do a "bitwise or" between values.  It
 * takes each corresponding bits in two values and the output is 1 if *either* or both of the
 * corresponding bits is 1.  If both corresponding bits are 0 then the corresponding bit is
 * set to 0.
 *
 * In other words:
 * 0  0  1  1    operand1
 * 0  1  0  1    operand2
 * ----------
 * 0  1  1  1    (operand1 | operand2) - returned result
