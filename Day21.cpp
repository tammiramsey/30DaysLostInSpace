/*
 * 30 Days - Lost in Space
 * Day 21 - Hello New World!
 *
 * For safe liftoff we're going to need to see and react to more information than
 * can be displayed on our 4 digit display or with LEDs.  Luckily our repair kit
 * contains just the thing, a small monochrome Organic LED display.
 *
 * This display has 8,128 tiny LEDs arranged in 64 rows of 128 pixels each.  Now, as
 * I'm sure you've noticed, we do NOT have 8,128 pins on our HERO board, but never
 * fear Explorer, people back in the 2020's were pretty clever and came up with a
 * solution.
 *
 * Instead of having one pin for every LED, The HERO will use two pins to send and
 * receive messages with our OLED display and will instruct the display which pixels
 * to light up using a special "language" (or "protocol") named I2C ("eye-squared-see").
 *
 * The HERO board uses pins A5 and A4 for I2C communications so we will wire those two
 * pins to our display along with power and ground, giving us a four wire connection
 * for displaying messages or pictures on our new display.

/*
 * Refer to the Day 21 lesson for instructions on how to install the U8g2
 * library into the Arduino IDE.  We will use this library to display messages
 * on our OLED display.
 *
 * Extensive documentation for this library can be found at https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2
 * for those wanting to dive deeper, but we will explain all of the functions
 * used in these lessons.

#include <U8g2lib.h>  // Include file for the U8g2 library.
 
/*
 * The U8g2 library supports many different types of display.  It does this by
 * having a different "constructor" for each.  A constructor is used to create
 * the "handle" that we use to access the libray code.  In this case, our handle
 * will be named "lander_display".
 *
 * The documentation for this library lists all of the displays supported along
 * with the corresponding constructors and options.  This constructor is for our
 * SH1106, 128x64 pixel generic display.  The "_F_" indicates that we will use
 * a full-sized graphics buffer and the clearBuffer()/sendBuffer() methods to
 * update the entire display at once. The "HW_I2C" indicates that we will be using
 * I2C communications with this display.

   * Even though we will only be displaying text in this lesson, our display is a

   *
   * By default, the cursor position is set to the bit at the lower-left of the
   * first character, but here we set this to be the UPPER-left of the first
   * character which makes it easier to position our first line of text on the top

   * loop() and set the delay at the end of the loop to the on/off time.
   *
   * To do this we will set a static variable (which keeps it's value between loop() executions)
   * and only write this message when the variable is true.  Then, at the end of the loop we
   * toggle the variable to the opposite value.
