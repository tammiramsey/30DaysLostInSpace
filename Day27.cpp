 * 30 Days - Lost in Space
 * Day 27 - Fun With Bitmaps, Part 2
 *
 * OK, now we know how to display bitmaps that cover the entire display,
 * but it would be very inefficient to pre-draw every possible display.
 *
 * Instead, we can reduce the size of our bitmaps to whatever size is
 * desired and then display the partial bitmaps.
 *
 * In addition, we won't just be displaying all the bitmaps in a loop so
 * we need a way to *select* which bitmaps are being displayed.
 *
 * Let's use our DIP switches to display one of eight different bitmaps.
 * Since we only have three switches we'll read each as a bit in a binary
 * number.  This way three switches can give us eight distinct values.
 *
 * We'll also add our 4 digit 7 segment display to show which picture
 * is currently being displayed.

 * Yesterday we showed a way to move our large bitmap declarations so that
 * our setup() and loop() code was near the top of our sketch using "forward
 * declarations".
 *
 * However, it turns out there's a simpler way, and we've seen it used many
 * times in the past.  We can simply MOVE our declarations into one or more
 * include files and then include them at the top of our sketch before we
 * reference them.
 *
 * To create a new file, simply click the "..." to the right of the tab bar with
 * our sketch name and select "New Tab".  Enter the name for the new file and
 * click the tab to edit.  This lets us move all of our bitmaps into a separate
 * file so we don't have to scroll through them.
